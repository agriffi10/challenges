# The Challenge Wiki
A repository of challenges to complete for education and portfolio pieces

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to create challenge pieces for anybody to complete in order to learn something new or use as a portfolio piece. Each challenge here will focus on one or more skill areas involved in developing websites and web applications.

## Contributing

If you have an idea for a challenge feel free to navigate over the issues page and submit it there! Once the challenge has been reviewed, it can be added to the wiki.

If you see something that is incorrect, such as a typo or something that needs to be adjusted, you can also make a bug report.
